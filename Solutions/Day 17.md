# Day 17

## Challenge

On December 17th, 1903, the first controlled flight of an airplane took place.

At the site of this achievement, a sculpture was built to allow visitors to experience and capture the scene, which is even visible from the sky.

At the moment of takeoff, someone stood about ten meters behind the aircraft, directly in line with it.

Who was this person (first name followed by last name)?

Answer format: Mark Twain

## My Methodology

- I first scoured through various articles on the famous flight, but nothing was mentioned about the positions of the team on that day.
- In the challenge it's mentioned that a sculpture is present at the site, so I visited Google Maps, and went to Wright Brothers National Memorial
- To the south of the memorial, I found the sculpture I was looking for. This is the view as same as the famous photo:

- Going around to the front of the Kitty Hawk, I found that there was indeed a person standing in front of the airplane.

- There is an information board too, and it shows the names of the friends who helped the brothers

- Looking at the board, it's clear who was standing in front of the airplane- -  Willis Dough
- Second question
  ```
  The exact takeoff spot is marked, and there is a commemorative plaque there.

  On what date (format YYYYMMDD) was this plaque installed?

  Answer format: 19031218
  ```
- For that, I needed to check out Google Maps' Street View again, and found the plaque at this location:
