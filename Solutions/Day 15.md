# Day 15

## Challenge

Agent, our client needs to know the business license from an inactive real estate company in Arizona, USA. Can you find the "Real Estate Limited Liability" number for RE/MAX EXCALIBUR ASSET SOLUTIONS, LLC? Good luck.

## My Methodology

- I searched 'arizona usa real estate register' on Google, and the first result seems to be the offical website

- In the new page, I clicked on the second search link - that will allow me to view a company's information
