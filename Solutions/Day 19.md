- Second question:
  ```
  The short story and the character of Scrooge have been widely adapted for television and the big screen in various formats and under different titles. One of the feature films, a musical, was broadcast on several French channels in the '90s, and a specialized French institute provides access to this information.
  On what date (format YYYYMMDD), after 1995, was it first broadcast on Canal+?
