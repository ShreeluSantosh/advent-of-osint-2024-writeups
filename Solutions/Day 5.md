# Day 5

## Challenge
> Among celebrities born on December 5th, this person created many worldwide-renowned artworks. <br>
> What was the original first name, which was eventually abandoned, given to their most famous creation?

## My Methodology
- I started with a simple Google Search ‘famous artists born on December 5’ and among the results, I found Walt Disney as the only person associated with artwork which is very famous
- I know that his famous creation is Mickey Mouse, so I opened the Wikipedia page on Mickey Mouse: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse
- In the second paragraph, the original name is present - Mortimer Mouse. So, the answer is Mortimer, which is correct.

- To my surprise, another question popped up:
>There is much speculation about the date when Mickey Mouse was first conceived.
>One of the hypotheses mentions the return trip from a disappointing visit to Charles Mintz. <br>
>So, according to this theory, on what date (format YYYYMMDD) was Mickey imagined? <br>
>Answer format: 19560521
    
- So, I went back to my browser, and entered in Google search - ‘when was Mickey Mouse imagined’. After browsing through various sites, I found one detailed site: https://mouseplanet.com/the-mickey-mouse-creation-myth/4195/

- The beloved cartoon character was conceived when Walt Disney was heading back home in a train, so the return date was given - March 13, 1928, which turned out to be correct.
- A third question popped up:
> Mickey was created to replace a former character due to contract and copyright issues. <br>
> What is the title of the first film featuring this character that was shown in theaters? <br>
> Answer format: Fire Angels
    
- The name of the replaced character is within the Wikipedia page I opened earlier - Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.
- On opening its Wikipedia page, I needed to look at the information pane (the right hand pane) to see its First Appearance - Trolley Troubles  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_the_Lucky_Rabbit

- Finally my mini-adventure into the Disney OSINT world came to an end with this reward
