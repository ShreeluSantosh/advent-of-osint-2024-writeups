A friend of yours sent you this image many years ago.

He seemed very agitated at the time and often spoke to you about a very specific date.

What was that date (format YYYYMMDD)?

## My Methodology

- I used reverse image search on the image in the challenge, and found that it is related to Mayan Calendar

- From the challenge, `very specific date` is mentioned. Following the pattern of previous challenges, some of which are centered around anniversaries, I decied to look up 'December 21 Mayan calendar'. What I found is related a famous phenomenon, where the calendar had predicted that the world would end on December 21, 2012. <br>

- No wonder our friend was agitated back then. The supposed date of end of the world is our answer - 20121221
