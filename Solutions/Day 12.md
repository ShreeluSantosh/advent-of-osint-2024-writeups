# Day 12

## Challenge

Nine years ago to the day, after several days of negotiation, a major agreement was adopted regarding the future of our planet.

During this time, a famous museum was closed to the public because it was located too close to the diplomatic area.

Upon entering this museum, what is the name (in french) of the room directly in front of us?

Answer format: Salle aux mille feux

## My Methodology

- If you've been regularly following up on current affairs, it's easy to guess the name of the agreement in the challenge - Paris Agreement, which was adopted on this day in 2015 (December 12, 2015)
- I went to its Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement), and found that it was adopted at 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference<br>

- Going to the Wikipedia page on that conference (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference), I found that it was held in Le Bourget in the suburbs of Paris, France<br>

- To double-check, I went to UN's official page on COP21 (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/cop21/), and found that the conference was held at a site close to Le Bourget<br>

- Finally, I Googled 'venue of COP21' and found this page https://unfccc.int/news/cop-21cmp-11-information-hub-venue-and-logistics. The venue is clearly the Parc des Expositions, 93350 Le Bourget.
- On Google Maps, I found the location of the venue, and noticed that there is a museum nearby with name of Mus√©e de l'Air et de l'Espace.

- After a bit of trial-and-error- I found a place at appears to be at the entrance of the museum with the name - Salle des Huit Colonnes. This turned out to the the first room that we see upon entering the museum.
- Alternate method: Access the museum's official website (https://www.museeairespace.fr/a-voir-a-faire/expositions-permanentes/) , look for visit route and you'll get a map of the museum. You'll easily find the name of the room at the entrance

- Second question:
  ```
  The Paris Agreement, adopted nine years ago, was not signed in Paris but in another city.

  In the Air and Space Museum, there is a restored aircraft that once connected these two cities nonstop.

  In the opposite direction, the crossing had been completed a few years earlier with a different aircraft.

  What is, in horsepower, the difference in power between the two aircraft?
  ```
- Back to the Wikipedia page on Paris Agreement, the below screenshot shows that the agreement was signed in New York.
- With that in mind, the aircraft that connected Paris and New York is certainly a renowned one - Concorde. And as it happens, Concorde is on display in the museum.

- I found that Concorde started flights from Paris to New York in 1977 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde_operational_history#Scheduled_flights)

- Still finding the name of the aircraft that made the crossing in the opposite direction a few years earlier - my guess is Lockheed SR-71 BlackBird (in 1974, which fits the challenge question - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_flight#Records_2). But the horsepower calculations don't add up

  Will update when I find the correct formula for calculating horsepower
