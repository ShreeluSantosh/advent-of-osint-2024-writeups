Snoop Dogg Claus is coming to town!

A few years back, Snoop Dogg rocked this Santa suit at a special event.

What song was playing when he hit the stage dressed like this?

Answer format: Hola Amigo

## My Methdology

- I did reverse image search on the photo in the challenge. Weird, the results didn't produce many matches for an image that is supposedly taken 'a few yers ago'.
- So, I added these keywords to the image search - 'snoop dogg santa event'
- Among the search results, I found one result from Getty Images

- I visited the Getty Images link, but couldn't find the matching Santa suit. So I decided to search the entire Getty Images with keywords - 'snoop dogg santa'
- I found a few matching results, which were taken at 2005 Radio Music Awards

- On clicking the exact image from the above results, I easily found the song name - Santa Baby
