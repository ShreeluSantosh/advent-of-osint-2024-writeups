# Day 22

## Challenge

During this holiday season, letâ€™s dive into the magical world of cinema with a film released in mid-February 1996, two months after its release in the United States.

The director of this film also directed, in the '90s, one of the first superhero movies adapted from a comic.

What is the original (English) title of this superhero movie?

Answer format: An history

## My Methodology

- From the challenge, I worked out that the film was released in the US in December 1995. 
- For list of films released in France in mid February 1996, I searched 'films released in france in mid-february 1996' and used this site: (https://www.boxofficemojo.com/month/february/1996/?sort=releaseDate&ref_=bo_md__resort#table) <br>

- I searched 'American films in 1995', and went to Wikipedia page for the same (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_1995#October%E2%80%93December). It has list of directors, actors, etc.
- After checking out each film's director's Wikipedia page and their filmography, I found a hit: Joe Johnston. He also directed The Rocketeer, a superhero film. This is our answer.
- Second question:
  ```
  The editor of "The Rocketeer" worked six years earlier with a renowned American director.
  In the 2000s, this director combined one of his signature techniques and his favorite actor in the same film. This movie was adapted from a book written by an author of children's books.
  This author wrote many other books.
  What is the title of the book he published in 1981?
  ```
- I went to the Wikipedia page for The Rocketeer, and was able to find the name of the film editor, Aruther Schmidt

- Given that he worked with a renowned director 6 years earlier, so I looked for films released in 1985, under his filmography. The film is Back to The Future.
