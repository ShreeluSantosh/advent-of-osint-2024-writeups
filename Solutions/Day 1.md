> This watch, of which part is visible, has become legendary. <br>
> On what date (format YYYYMMDD) did it take off?

## My Methodology
- I first used reverse image search on this image, which revealed that the model in question is Seiko Pogue

- Then, I used Google search for launch date of this watch. It revealed that it was May 1969. (https://www.craftandtailored.com/products/1974-seiko-chronograph-ref-6139-6005-pogue-1) However, it was not the correct answer.

- In further search, the launch year remained 1969. I wondered if the date was different for different countries. On closer look at the problem, I realized that I had misunderstood the phrase ‘*take off*’ which I had assumed to be ‘launched’. This phrase could mean when the watch started gaining popularity.
- Some more digging via Google revealed this article: https://www.beyondthedial.com/post/collector-guide-the-seiko-pogue/

- Since the astronaut took this watch into space for a while, I assumed that the start date, November 16, 1973, would be when people took notice of this iconic watch. 19731116 turned out to be the correct answer.
