## My Methodology

- The image in the challenge gave me a chance to do some image search. In the Images tab of Google search, using the words in the image, I found an exact match

- The website linked to this image gave more information about the image (see image 27/43 in the image gallery):

- The caption contains the answer to the question - sapin de Noël = a Christmas Tree
- The second question goes like this:
  ```
  In the newspaper where the previous illustration was from, 50 years earlier on Christmas Day, a lit Christmas tree made the front page.

  In which city was this tree located?

  Answer format: Madrid
  ```
- Le's do some quick mathematics. The photo above is from 1974, as indicated by the website. So, 50 years earlier would be 1924. So I need to search for some archive of that newspaper, which is Le Progrès, which has newspaper records from 100 years ago.
- A simple Google search 'Archives Le Progrès Lyon 1924' led me to this:

- In the archives page, I went to December 25, 1924, as per the question:

- From (https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bd6t527439503?rk=21459;2), I easily found the image of the Christmas tree at the bottom of the cover page:

- Though it was a bit hard to read, the caption at the bottom of the photo mentioned a city - Copenhague

- I didn't need to use Google Translate to know which city it was referring to - Copenhagen (capital of Denmark).
