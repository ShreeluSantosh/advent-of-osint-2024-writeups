# Day 16

## Challenge

According to a source there are classified documents from the Russian Embassy sitting in a Swedish car with the registration number EDX 34C, downtown Stockholm. To retrieve the documents covertly, they need the VIN number to gain access to the car. It's supposedly a Volvo. Can you find the VIN of that car?

## My Methodology

- In Google, I searched 'Sweden VIN lookup', and found a Reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/fugrh5/find_owner_of_car_in_sweden_number_plate_vin/?rdt=57860
- I found a potential website: https://biluppgifter.se/

- In the search bar on the website, I entered the registration number given in the challenge

- And voila! The VIN number is clear to me
