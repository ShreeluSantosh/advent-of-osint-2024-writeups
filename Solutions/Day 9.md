# Day 9

## Challenge

During World War II, cyber defense did not exist. However, to counter potential German wiretapping and protect communications, resistance fighters relied on encoding and intelligence techniques. The struggle to safeguard their messages was intense!

Using a telephone code commissioned on April 15, 1945, you can decrypt the following message: 

« Ursule, Théophile, Victor, Noemie, Georges, Emile, Kleber, Bernard, Robert, Marie, Xavier, Xavier, Georges, Emile ».

What is the decrypted message (as written in french)?

Answer format: fondue au poivre

## My Methodology

- First, I tried with various search terms 'world war 2 telephone code', 'telephone code used by french resistance', etc. But nothing came up. After the video solution, I realized that I need to use French search terms. So I went with 'code téléphonique de la seconde guerre mondiale' (telephone code second world war), and I easily found a PDF file on the telephone code (https://www.arcsi.fr/doc/Tant/SecondeGuerreMondiale.pdf):

- Using the cipher below, I easily decoded the message in the challenge:

  ```
  Ursule, Théophile, Victor, Noemie, Georges, Emile, Kleber, Bernard, Robert, Marie, Xavier, Xavier, Georges, Emile
  M A Q U I S  D E  L O R R I S
  ```
- The second question is
  ```
  The Marquis of Lorris was the most significant operation organized in the Loiret department by French resistance fighters during World War II.

  There is an association composed of former members of this Marquis who work to perpetuate the duty of remembrance. In 2024, the annual commemoration ceremony was unique and marked by the performance of an exceptional musical ensemble.

   Who led this ensemble (first and last name)?
  ```
- I started with looking for 'Maquis de Lorris' on Google. This led me to this:

- The answer is Emilie Fleury.
- The final question is:
  ```
  The Republican Guard Orchestra and the Choir of the French Army regularly perform under various conductors or choir directors.

  After the concert in Amilly, in which city did Commander Émilie Fleury once again conduct the ensemble?

  Answer format: Verdun
  ```
- I've taken the answer directly from the video solution because for some reason, Facebook wouldn't let me create an account for my sock puppet.
