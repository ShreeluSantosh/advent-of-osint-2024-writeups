## My Methodology

- Reverse image search of the image in the challenge didn't give me any matches, so I decided to focus on the facts in the challenge. The only hint from the image is the UN flag on the left of the picture. So, combining this clue with the challenge, it's clear that an UN treaty was ratified on Dece,ber 24, 2014.
- Armed with this information, I searched "UN treaty ratified on December 24, 2014", and got the name of the treaty - Arms Trade Treaty

- I searched for the list of nations that have ratified the treaty, and found this file: https://thearmstradetreaty.org/hyper-images/file/List%20of%20ATT%20States%20Parties%20(by%20order%20of%20deposit)(17%20October%202024)/List%20of%20ATT%20States%20Parties%20(by%20order%20of%20deposit)(17%20October%202024).pdf
- I searched for the nation that last ratified the treaty before December 24, 2014 - and that is South Africa.

- My assumption was that the UN permanent representative (or UN ambassador) of South Africa would have to sign the treaty. So I looked up the lost of UN permanent representatives from South Africa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Representative_of_South_Africa_to_the_United_Nations).
- The UN permanent representative in 2014 was Jeremiah Kingsley Mamabolo

- The answer is Mamabolo.
