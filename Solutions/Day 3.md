## My Methodology

- I first did a simple reverse image search on Google Images. The results showed me that the image was taken from this site: [https://www.lgprestige-immobilier-mandelieu.com/fr/propriété/84518475](https://www.lgprestige-immobilier-mandelieu.com/fr/propri%C3%A9t%C3%A9/84518475)
  
- Interestingly, the site does not mention any address, so I went back to image search results and found this: https://properties.lefigaro.com/announces/villa-alpes+maritimes-provence+alpes+cote+d+azur-france/67627904/  . Also, it says that in order to get the address, I’d have to drop an enquiry.
- The first site did mention that the villa was located in Le Suquet, in Cannes, which narrowed down my search area

- The first site also had an embedded map, but when I zoomed in and used it as reference for Google Maps, the exact location fell in the middle of a road, and the surroundings didn’t match the photo.

- After unsuccessful image searches using different photos from the site, I stumbled upon a YouTube video of the villa tour 
- Near the end, at 2:00-2:06 mark, the villa is zoomed out, showing the beachside and the hills in the distance.

- I opened Google Maps on my phone for ease, and used the landmarks encircled as references. Considering the perspective, I was able to determine the rough location of the villa by drawing a line through the 2 small piers, 3 buildings, and a red-roofed low building, and the extrapolating it inland.

- After a false step which took me between Av. Maréchal Juin and Pointe Croisette, I recentered my focus on Le Supuet area.
- Going back to the video (at 1:57 mark), I noticed a parapet and a flag near the villa, as well as a zig-zag road (don’t know the exact word, but see the image below and you’ll understand what I mean)

- I opened the Street View, and after checking the surroundings along the road, I ended up behind the villa, at a road named rue Louis Perrissol <br>

- As I didn’t see a front gate of the villa, I assumed that what I was looking at could be the entrance to the villa, at 50 rue Louis Perrissol

- I was close, the correct answer is 48 rue Louis Perrissol. This challenge took me more than an hour, but was worth the fun.
