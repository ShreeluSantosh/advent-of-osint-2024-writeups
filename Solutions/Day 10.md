## My Methodology:

- Via Yandex Images search and Google Image search, I found that this photo was taken in Gamla Stan (Old Town), in Stockholm, capital of Sweden.

- I went to Google Maps and entering 'Gamla Stan' in search bar and using Street View, I found that the name of the museum is pretty obvious

- Answer: Nobel Prize Museum
- The second question:
  ```
  The youngest Nobel Prize winner gave a speech in which she mentioned several people, including one of her "sisters" from Syria.

  What is this name?

  Answer format: Isabel
  ```
- I think we can guess who this 'youngest Nobel Prize winner' is - Malala Yousafzai. I search for her speech, which led me to her Nobel Prize acceptance speech (https://malala.org/newsroom/malala-nobel-speech)
- I found this paragraph where she mentions the names of her 'sisters':

- It's easy to find the name of the sister from Syria - Muzoon
- The third question is:
  ```
  When he was a child, the oldest recipient suffered from a problem that was poorly understood at the time.

  What was it? (in french)

  Answer format: Insomnie
  ```
- I searched for 'oldest nobel prize winner' on Google, and found that his name is John B. Goodenough, who received Nobel Prize at the age of 97.
- In his Wikipedia page, I found this paragraph, where his childhood illness is mentioned - dyslexia (in French, it's dyslexie)

- The final question is
  ```
  Finally, one of the recipients was affected by a disease that only a few "Nobel laureates" develop. Defending a widely controversial thesis during his speech, he set some sort of speed record.

  What is his last name?

  Answer format: Lorenz
  ```
- I copied the question in Google search, and the first result that came up is Nobel Disease - not an actual disease, but an informal term as seen below:

- In the link to the Wikipedia page, I found a list of Nobel laureates who are reported as examples. I decided to brute-force my way until I got answer - Nikolaas 'Tinbergen'
