## My Methodology
- I Googled 'Companions of St Nicholas', and went to the Wikipedia page on this topic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companions_of_Saint_Nicholas). I found the names of companions:

- I coudn't find anything from the Wikipedia article, so after taking a hint from the video solution, I went back and found this (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companions_of_Saint_Nicholas#Zwarte_Piet_(Black_Pete)):

- I found this in the Wikipedia page on Pere Fouettard (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A8re_Fouettard):

- In the Wikipedia article on Hans von Trotha (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_von_Trotha), I found the name of his castle -

- Interestingly, the above screenshot mentions an outwork named Little France. I thought that it could be an outpost.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_France_(castle) gave me the name for the question: Klein-Frankreich

- The challenge gave me next question:
  > On Hans von Trotha's stone, the names of two saints are engraved. <br>
  >  What are the names of these two saints? <br>
  > Answer format: Pierre Paul
- I tried 'Hans von Trotha's gravestone' and many similar keywords and came up with nothing. I noticed that the legend is related to France, so I translated the first search phrase to 'Compagnons de saint Nicolas chevalier' and found a PDF file on Hans von Trotha (https://www.ecomusee.alsace/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/hs35-vontrotha.pdf):

- On 11th page of the PDF, I found an image of what appears to be the tombstone of Hans von Trotha:

- By translating the highlighted text above, I got the answer of the second question:
  ```
  Our knight Hans von Trotha,
  which the French called "Jean
  Drott' dies in his castle
  on 25 October 1503. He is buried
  in a small dedicated chapel
  to Saint Anne at the bottom of the castle
  Berwartstein. We can
  See the tombstone of our
  A knight who reads:
  â€œAnno Domini 1503, off. Dorstag.
  vor. Simon. Vnd. Jude. der. streng.
  Her. Hans. von. Drott. Ritter. dem.
  Got. genedig. sy. Amen. "
  (Anto of our Lord 1503, in
  on that day of the Saints Simon and Jude,
  the knight Hans von Drott was
  entrusted to the grace of God. Amen.)
  ```
- The answer is Simon Jude
