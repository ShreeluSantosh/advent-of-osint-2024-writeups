# Day 9

## Challenge

During World War II, cyber defense did not exist. However, to counter potential German wiretapping and protect communications, resistance fighters relied on encoding and intelligence techniques. The struggle to safeguard their messages was intense!

Using a telephone code commissioned on April 15, 1945, you can decrypt the following message: 

« Ursule, Théophile, Victor, Noemie, Georges, Emile, Kleber, Bernard, Robert, Marie, Xavier, Xavier, Georges, Emile ».

What is the decrypted message (as written in french)?

Answer format: fondue au poivre
