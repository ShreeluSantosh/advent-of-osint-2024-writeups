# Day 16

## Challenge

According to a source there are classified documents from the Russian Embassy sitting in a Swedish car with the registration number EDX 34C, downtown Stockholm. To retrieve the documents covertly, they need the VIN number to gain access to the car. It's supposedly a Volvo. Can you find the VIN of that car?
