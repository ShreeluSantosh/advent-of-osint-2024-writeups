> Nativity scenes have been popular for hundreds of years. Whilst most are small, some can be quite large. <br>
> The figure shows four close-up photos of a highly detailed diorama featuring a nativity scene. <br>
> According to the official count, how many pieces were used (at least) in the 2023 set?

## My Methodology
- I first opened the image in a separate tab for clearer view. Then I took screenshots of each of the 4 images within the image.
- I used Google’s reverse image search for each image to see what kind of results I would get.
- I got a hit with the 4th (bottom-right) image of the Colosseum figure. The hit was in form of an article: https://algarvemoods.com/en/nativity-scene-vrsa/

- The location of the nativity scene is Vila Real de Santo Antonio, in Portugal.

- Now that I have the name of the place, I needed to do a simple Google search ‘large nativity scene in Vila Real de Santo Antonio 2023’.
  The first result took me to this article: https://www.portugalresident.com/largest-nativity-scene-in-portugal-to-be-unveiled-in-vrsa/
- The third paragraph in the article contains the answer to our challenge - 5800
